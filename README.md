Please read the file `credit-scoring-exam-01.pdf`. 

## Usage

There are two standalone python application: 
* `cashflows`
* `monty-hall`

Each contain their own dependencies and application code. Thus, two different virtual-environments are required. 

Solve the problems on each application and git-push the changes into the `master` branch of your fork-repo.
