# **Part 1**: (40 pts) Theory

## **(6 pts)** - Credit Risk Theory

The following equation describes the expected loss for a credit operation: 

$$EL = PD * EAD * LGD$$

Where:

* $EL$: expected loss
* $PD$: probability of default
* $EAD$: exposure at default
* $LGD$: loss given default

(1.5 pts) When doing a credit risk model, which variable are we interested in forecasting?

\ 

(1.5 pts) What are the "units" for the $EL$ and $EAD$? 

\ 

(3 pts) In your own words, explain the concept of $LGD$.  
**Hint**: remember that $LGD$ is a percentage (%).  
  
\   
\   
\   
\   
\   
\   

## **(7 pts)** - Credit Scoring Performance

We can use two strategies to improve credit-scoring performance:

* **Strategy 1**: Increase data quality, availability, and volume (e.g., big data)
* **Strategy 2**: Use more complex modeling techniques (e.g., non-linear models)

(3.5 pts) In your own words, explain the disadvantages of only using **strategy 1**.

 \   
 \   
 \   
 \   
 \   
 \     

(3.5 pts) In your own words, explain the disadvantages of only using **strategy 2**.

\   
\   
\   
\   
\   
\   

## **(7 pts)** - Data Quality Dimensions

(2 pts) In your own words, explain the importance of the `SEC` (Security) dimension on financial data: 

\   
\   
\   
\   
\   
\   

(2 pts) Give an example of data that's sensible to the `TIM` (Timeliness) dimension. Elaborate: 

\   
\   
\   
\   
\   
\   

(3 pts) What's the difference between the `COM` (Completeness) and `AC` (Accuracy) data dimensions? Give an example. 

\   
\   
\   
\   
\   
\

class Human:

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, **kwargs):
        self.date_of_birth = dt.datetime.strptime(date_of_birth, STRING_FORMAT_DATE)
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
        self._kwargs = kwargs

    @property
    def age(self):
        today, dob = dt.datetime.today(), self.date_of_birth
        adjust = (today.month, today.day) < (self.dob.month, self.dob.day)
        return today.year - self.dob.year - adjust
    
    
    def greeting(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Greeting method is not implemented")
```

\newpage

Child class `Student` definition: 

\   

```python

class Student(Human):
    notebook_name = "notes"

    @property
    def notes(self):
        return self._kwargs.get(self.notebook_name, "")

    def add_note(self, note):
        notes_content = self.notes + note
        self._kwargs[self.notebook_name] = notes_content

    def greeting(self):
        return "My name is {student_name} and I'm {student_age} years old.".format(
            student_name=self.full_name, student_age=self.age)
```

Child class `Professor` definition: 

\   

```python

class Professor(Human):

    @property
    def lecture(self):
        return self._kwargs.get("lecture")

    def assign_lecture(self, lecture_name, override=False, fail=True):
        FAIL_MESSAGE = f"Cannot assign lecture {lecture_name} to professor " + \
                        f"{self.full_name} because {self.lecture} was previously assigned."
        if not self.lecture or override:
            self._kwargs["lecture"] = lecture_name
        elif not fail:
            print(FAIL_MESSAGE)
        else:
            raise ValueError(FAIL_MESSAGE)
        
    def greeting(self):
        return "I'm Prof. {professor_last_name} and {lecture_details}.".format(
            professor_last_name=self.last_name,
            lecture_details=f"I am teaching a lecture named '{self.lecture}'" 
                if self.lecture else "I am currently not teaching any lecture")
```


Name the attributes, and methods of the following classes: 

* (2 pts) `Student`
    * Attributes: 
    * Methods: 
    
* (2 pts) `Professor` 
    * Attributes:

professor = Professor(
    first_name="Erwin", 
    last_name="SchrÃ¶dinger",
    date_of_birth="1887-08-12"
)

# A) First greeting
greeting_a = professor.greeting()

# B) Second greeting
professor.assign_lecture(lecture_name="Quantum Mechanics", fail=False)
greeting_b = professor.greeting()

1. Change directory into the repository.
    * `cd 958d7822-da73-4bbc-817f-fa79ac0778bc`
1. There are 2 standalone python applications:
    * `cashflows`
    * `monty-hall`
1. Solve the problems and push your changes to the master branch.
    * `git status`
    * `git add path/to/file.py`

\   

## **(5 pts)** - *Extra Points!* 

(5 pts) Implement and apply decorator on the monty-hall problem: 

* There's a decorator in the `util.py` file named: `remember_function_output_decorator`.
* Assume this decorator will only be used in `Guest` methods. 
* Implementation: the decorator should automatically save the output of a method into the Guest's memory (list). 
* Apply the decorator on the following methods. Modify as needed. 
    * `_choose_strategy_random`
    * `_choose_strategy_change`
    * `_choose_strategy_stay`
